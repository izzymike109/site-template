								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Do you who love woodworking, but just do it as a hobby? If you have a passion in woodworking, then using it to create a part time or full time business is achievable. It is plausible to earn a substantial amount by applying your woodworking skills with just a small startup cost.</p>

<p>According to the UN the overall manufacturing sector generates about $12 trillion in annual revenue, and the wood product manufacturing industry is a $6 billion industry that continues to grow. With the top 50 businesses commanding about 35 percent of the market, there are enough opportunities for new and small businesses. Along with the overload of inferior quality furniture and poor craftsmanship from some larger companies, this is something you can compete with.</p>

<p>Are you interested in starting a Woodworking Business? This is a step by step guide on how to turn use your skill woodworking talent and become a successful business owner</p>

<h3 id="Specialize"><strong>Specialize In A Niche To Succeed</strong></h3>

<p>Woodworking is such vast topic and it would be beneficial to select a precise niche for your woodworking business. From making toys to furniture and more, the opportunities are limitless. To identify your niche, you will need to determine an uncovered area. Look for any woodwork area which is not sufficiently provided for and maximize your efforts within this area. For example, let us consider garden benches. Check the gardens within your locality and investigate what type of benches people have. You could produce high-quality benches to sell to this market.</p>

<p>Without a niche to guide you, you’ll lose focus somewhere along the road. When looking for a niche, take into account what tools and space is available to you. Some projects require power machines, while others are easy to do with simple hand tools.</p>

<p>In business, it is always useful to have a sense of direction. Having a blueprint to follow that will constantly advise you is also easier. For your business, niche marketing is important. Before you even purchase your tools, make certain you determine the correct niche.</p>

<h3 id="WhattoBuild"><strong>What To Build To Make Profits</strong></h3>

<p>Turning woodworking from your hobby to a business is achievable. Different markets will require different woodwork projects. For example, if you’re making toys, target parents with young kids. If you are selling toys to middle-aged and retired people, you would be very targeting the wrong market. Also, producing garden benches in a locality where people barely have gardens wouldn’t generate much money. Identify the correct projects to make for the correct market will start you on the correct path to success. Here are some excellent projects you can make to bring in a good profit.</p>

<p>Toys</p>

<p>Toys are simple projects that won’t involve an abundance of resources from you. You can create wonderful toys comfortably with hand tools most people have in their garage already. Small items projects don’t take up much space, so this could be a good choice to start out of your garage.</p>

<p>Furniture</p>

<p>Just take a brief peek at your friends&#8217; pieces of furniture. Have you noted that most of their furniture is wooden? From the coffee table to the chairs, many people use wood. Consider which wooden furniture people would not do without and produce these items.</p>

<p>Fences</p>

<p>Many people prefer wood in their fences. It causes the home to look more natural and simpler to set up. You will constantly meet people who need to repair their fence while others will require new fences. Since the fence serves as security, you will undoubtedly receive requests to make and repair fences.</p>

<h3 id="Costs"><strong>Woodworking Business-Learn To Control Your Costs</strong></h3>

<p>Any form of business requires you to know how to work out your costs. Virtually every handmade product has a “perfect price.” Charge higher and it won’t sell; charge less and you’re losing money. To get the correct selling price involves five separate calculations, Material costs for goods, labor, overhead, profit and selling expenses. You can calculate these by hand, or use your computer and a spreadsheet. A classic formula to follow is materials cost plus 10% + (hourly rate x project hours).</p>

<h3 id="SalesChannel"><strong>Create Your Sales Channel &#8211; Offline and Online</strong></h3>

<p>Like any other form of business, woodworking will require you to take advantage of the best marketing strategies if you wish to make healthy profits. Many people promote their business online and offline nowadays. You can use both sets of advertising in unique ways. Let’s start with the offline advertising strategies.</p>

<p>For quite some time now, offline marketing strategies have been around. People would promote their business by using posters, fliers, advertisements in newspapers, magazines and many more before computers and the internet. Many still read the papers and read the ads. These are wonderful sales channel to use.</p>

<p>We cannot overlook computers and the internet which has transformed how many are running their business. The online marketing also comes in several ways, like the offline system.</p>

<p>You can set up a blog free. On blogs you can share your ideas and product available to purchase. Using forums is another way. There are many forums that will talk specifically about a particular field. Find woodworking forums on the internet for inspiration and advice.</p>

You get the marketing message to stay in your customers’ mind for longer with offline marketing. Use both methods to give you the maximum benefits.</p>

<h3 id="BusinessPlan"><strong>The Importance Of A Business Plan</strong></h3>

<p>If you’re on a long trip, then it’s important that you have a roadmap that will see you getting to your destination safely. With this in mind, it is also important that you consider getting a plan that is more or less like the roadmap that will get you to realize your business goals you set right from the beginning.</p>

<p>There are many places where you will need to have your business plan in place. For example, if you are requesting a loan from the bank for a business purpose, they will always require you to have a business plan with you. The bank takes their time to access the plan to determine if what you are proposing to do is viable and if it is, are the gains worth the loan? They will go through the targets and targets, access the money needed, the location, and more. With the plan then they can comfortably give you the capital if they find your proposal to be a strong idea.</p>

<p>To have a plan is to support you from where you come from and where you’re heading. To identify what you have accomplished and where you are faltering, review the plan from time to time.</p>

<p>If you’ve been running a defined strategy, you need to review it so you can tell if it works or not. You can abandon those strategies that don’t work and embrace those that work. It is the comparisons that will show whether your business is on the correct path between the milestones achieved and those not achieved. Know that the business plan is your business foundation and therefore you need the right one.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As a woodworker, you may have realized that finding the right detailed plans to build some custom projects to meet specific needs can be very difficult. This is among the most common problems woodworkers face today, but luckily for you, this and other related problem shouldn’t bother you.</p>

<p>At <a href="http://03919h0pzd4l8wafozvaqx2lbi.hop.clickbank.net/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">TedsWoodworking.com</a>, Ted Mcgrath, a certified master woodworker, trainer, and author gives more than 16,000 plans, with step-by-step blueprints for various woodworking projects.</p>

<p><strong>So what’s <a href="http://03919h0pzd4l8wafozvaqx2lbi.hop.clickbank.net/">TedsWoodworking</a> all about?</strong></p>

<p>Building complex projects or even the simple ones to meet specific needs can be very difficult even to experienced woodworkers especially when you can’t find a detailed plan. And most of the so-called “step by step” guides found online and in various magazines make building some projects harder than it should be. This is because the plans are sometimes not specific enough or their instructions leave out crucial information assuming that you have enough experience to know what to do.</p>

<p>In addition, often, such plans don’t have enough detail. For instance, some don’t include pictures or the pictures they have don’t match what they are telling you. Still, some don’t even include cut sheets, so you are forced to “guesstimate” materials.</p>

<p>Ted Mcgrath spent over 25 years studying these problems and finding solutions. He put together a comprehensive collection of wood-working plans. <a href="http://03919h0pzd4l8wafozvaqx2lbi.hop.clickbank.net/">Tedswoodworking.com</a> is his website which offers woodworkers solutions to various woodworking problems, especially those related to finding the right plans for various projects.
